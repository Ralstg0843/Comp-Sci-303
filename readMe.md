This project implements basic array operations in C++ without using vectors.  
This project should include the following functions:
1) A function to check if a certain integer exists in the array if the number is present return the
index where the number is present.
2) A function that can modify the value of an integer when called with the index of the integer in
the array and return the new value and old value back to the user.
3) A function that adds a new integer to the end of the array
4) A function which intakes an index of an array and removes the integer altogether.
It should also follow the guidelines below :
1) Add a try and catch blocks to the user inputs for the following functions from question 1:
2) A function that can modify the value of an integer when called with the index of
the integer in the array and return the new value and old value back to the user.
3) A function that adds a new integer to the end of the array
